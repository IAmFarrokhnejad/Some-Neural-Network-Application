% This code segment loads a dataset called "bodyfat_dataset.mat", likely containing inputs and corresponding targets related to body fat measurements. It then constructs a neural network model using the newrb function, which is a radial basis function network. The inputs and targets from the dataset are used to train this neural network. After training, the network is used to predict outputs (Y) based on the input data (bodyfatInputs).
% Subsequently, it creates a figure and plots a regression analysis comparing the actual body fat targets (bodyfatTargets) against the predicted values (Y) generated by the neural network. This allows for visualization and evaluation of the network's performance in approximating the body fat measurements.
