# Some-Neural-Network-Application
This repository contains various NN codes converted from Matlab to Python


The Matlab codes were initially developed by Prof. Dr. Ahmet Rizaner: https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=tr&user=A5l1iE8AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate


We implemented minor modifications on the Matlab files and converted them into Python.



Note: Before running each Python code, make sure to install the required libraries unless they are intrinsically integrated with Python.
